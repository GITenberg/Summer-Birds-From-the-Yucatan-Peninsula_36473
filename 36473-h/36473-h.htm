INTRODUCTION
</p>
<p>
Because its unique geographical location and ecological setting supports a rich and varied avifauna, the Yucat&#225;n Peninsula has received considerable attention by ornithologists. The most valuable contribution is Paynter's "The Ornithogeography of the Yucat&#225;n Peninsula" (1955a), an authoritative study of the composition, distribution, and origin of the avifauna of the region. His work contains a complete listing of all species reported to that time from the peninsula. It considers the hundreds of specimens collected by the author and his associates during many months of field work, provides a synthesis of all the information available to 1955, and is the basic reference to the avifauna of the area. Paynter also pointed out matters for which information is lacking. Two of the most conspicuous deficits that he noted are the lack of knowledge about many species that occur on the peninsula in summer, and the paucity of data as to time of breeding, although some information on reproduction in a few species was published subsequently by Paynter (1955b) and Storer (1961).
</p>
<p>
In July and August of 1962, I was a member of a field party from the Museum of Natural History, The University of Kansas, engaged in a survey of vertebrates and their ectoparasites on the Yucat&#225;n Peninsula. The purpose of the present paper is to report on the birds collected and observed during the course of this field work. Particular emphasis is given to breeding information, but observations concerning distribution, incidence, and molt also are given. In addition, a list of the chewing lice (Mallophaga) taken from various specimens is given in Table 2 and in the appropriate species account of the host. Other ectoparasites removed from these birds will be reported on elsewhere.
</p>
<br>
<p class="ctr">
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
</p>
<p>
I am especially indebted to Dr. J. Knox Jones, Jr., under whose direction this field study was undertaken, and to Dr. Richard F. Johnston who aided greatly in the identification of specimens and critical reading of the manuscript. I am grateful also to other members of the field party who helped in collecting many of the specimens reported herein: Ticul Alvarez, A. Binion Amerson, Dr. William E. Duellman, Dr. J. Knox Jones, Jr., Thomas E. Lovejoy, III, Jack G. Makepeace, Dwight R. Platt, William C. Stanley, Jerome B. Tulecke, and John Wellman. Dr. K. C. Emerson graciously identified the specimens of Mallophaga and Dr. Allan R. Phillips aided in identification of some of the birds.
</p>
<p>
In addition, I wish to express sincere thanks for quarters provided our field party at the Campo Experimental Forestal "El Tormento" at Esc&#225;rcega, Campeche, by Ing. Hector Flores S.; at Pueblo Nuevo X-can, Quintana Roo, by Pablo Alimilla; at Felipe Carrillo Puerto, Quintana Roo, by Fernando Esquival Montono; and at Pist&#233;, Yucat&#225;n, by Luis V. Polanco. The field party benefited also from arrangements and helpful suggestions made by Eduardo C. Welling of M&#233;rida and Marynoll Father Joseph Early of Felipe Carrillo Puerto. Wherever we camped the local Mayans were exceptionally helpful, especially as guides and collectors.
</p>
<p>
Our field party was composed of two units. One unit, working on a survey of Middle American vertebrates and their ectoparasites, was supported by the United States Army Medical Research and Development Command (Contract No. DA-49-193-MD-2215). The second unit, composed of students in the Field Course in Vertebrate Zoology from The University of Kansas, was supported in part by the Museum of Natural History and by a grant from the National Science Foundation (G 20939, Special Projects in Science Education). The late Ing. Luis Mac&#237;as Arellano, Departamento de la Fauna Silvestre, Direcci&#243;n General de Caza, M&#233;xico, D.F., generously provided the necessary permits for collecting vertebrates.
</p>

<p class="ctr">
PHYSICAL FEATURES
</p>
<p>
The Yucat&#225;n Peninsula is a northeastern projection of Central America lying between the Gulf of Campeche, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea. Its area is approximately 143,500 square kilometers and includes the Mexican states of Campeche and Yucat&#225;n and the sparsely settled Territory of Quintana Roo, plus parts of British Honduras and the Pet&#233;n region of Guatamala. The peninsula has a mean breadth of about 300 kilometers and a coast line of about 1100 kilometers.
</p>
<p>
Topographically, the peninsula is a low-level plain that rises gradually inland to the south. The coast on the north and west is low, sandy, and semi-barren; openings through the outer coastal strand lead to narrow brackish lagoons surrounded by mangroves. The eastern coast consists of bluffs, indented with bays and bordered by several islands, the largest being Cozumel. A small range of hills traverses the peninsula from the city of Campeche to Chetumal Bay; although appearing sizeable, these almost nowhere exceed 100 meters in elevation. The extreme southerly portion of the peninsula is moderately hilly and is covered with tropical rain forest.
</p>
<p>
The peninsula is composed almost wholly of a bed of coraline and porous limestone covered with a layer of thin, dry soil formed from the slow weathering of the bedrock. The humus is rarely more than a few centimeters deep, and consequently cornfields (<i>milpas</i>) must be moved every two or three years. With each move a new area of the land is cleared and burned. This agricultural practice has been routine with the Mayan people for centuries and apparently has had a profound effect on the vegetation, severely limiting the extent of virgin forest.
</p>
<p>
In many places, especially in the northern part of the peninsula, the rocky surface of the terrain is perforated by natural wells or sink-holes, which are called
<i>
cenotes
</i>
locally. Many
<i>
cenotes
</i>
support small "islands" of unique vegetation, the composition of which somewhat resembles the rain forest of the southern part of the peninsula. Temporary water-holes and shallow lakes (<i>aguadas</i>) are sparsely scattered throughout the southern half of the peninsula. There are no rivers of importance; most that are present are in the southernmost region.
</p>
<p>
The climate of northern Yucat&#225;n is hot and dry, and the absence of high mountainous ridges to intercept the moisture-bearing clouds from the Atlantic accounts for less rain than would be expected. The southernmost part of the peninsula receives a maximum of 200 centimeters of rain annually. The amount decreases toward the north to an average of about 45 centimeters. Almost all of the rain falls from May to October. Daily temperatures range from 78&#176; to 98&#176; F. in the shade; cool sea winds prevail day and night throughout most of the year. The hottest months are May and June. In winter, fierce northers,
<i>
temporales
</i>
or
<i>
nortes</i>, occasionally sweep across this open region, bringing rain and cooler temperatures, lasting several days.
</p>
<p>
The areas adjacent to British Honduras and Guatemala receive sufficient rainfall to support forests containing mahogany (<i>Swietenia</i>); sapodilly (<i>Achras</i>); several valuable cabinet woods; logwood (<i>Haematozylon</i>) and other dyewoods. As one proceeds northward the flora and fauna change gradually from that of the wet tropics to that of the dry tropics.
</p>
<p>
Paynter's (1955a) system of vegetational zones on the peninsula is useful to ornithologists. He recognized three zones: Scrub, Deciduous Forest, and Rain Forest. The Scrub zone occupies Isla Holbox and Isla Mujeres and the arid northern coast of Yucat&#225;n. The zone extends only a few miles inland and consists of low-tropical thorn forest of mesquite (<i>Prosopsis</i>),
<i>
Mimosa</i>,
<i>
Yucca</i>,
<i>
Agave</i>, and mangrove (<i>Rhizophora</i>) wherever standing water occurs. Sisal in Yucat&#225;n and Isla Mujeres of Quintana Roo are in this Scrub zone.
</p>
<p>
The Deciduous Forest zone is a vast area of low, semiarid, secondary forest occupying all of the state of Yucat&#225;n not in the Scrub zone, northern Campeche, and a thin strip a few kilometers wide in Quintana Roo along the Yucat&#225;n-Quintana Roo border and a similar narrow band along the eastern coast. The island of Cozumel is also included in this zone. Collections were made in the Deciduous Forest at Champot&#243;n, Campeche, Isla Cozumel and Puerto Ju&#225;rez, Quintana Roo, and Pist&#233;, Yucat&#225;n.
</p>
<p>
The Rain Forest zone occupies the remainder of the peninsula and includes most of the territory of Quintana Roo, and the southern half of Campeche. Collections were made in this zone at Esc&#225;rcega, Campeche, and at Felipe Carrillo Puerto and Pueblo Nuevo X-can, Quintana Roo. Isla del Carmen cannot be accurately assigned to any of these three zones because most of the island has been planted in coconut palms. It is an area of high rainfall and may once have supported rainforest.
</p>
<p>
In the present report the term "second growth" refers to areas that have been recently cut over. In these areas, the forest is characteristically low and in a stage of transition. In the Rain Forest zone "second growth" areas usually contain species of deciduous trees.
</p>
<p>
Paynter (1955a) has given an excellent descriptive summary of the topography, climate, and phytogeography of the Yucat&#225;n Peninsula and there is little need to go into further detail here. During summer, the rainy season, the Deciduous Forest is much more luxuriant in appearance than in winter when most of the trees have lost their leaves. Also, the numerous
<i>
cenotes
</i>
in this zone support a limited growth of evergreen trees. For example, the large Cenote Seco about two kilometers east of Chich&#233;n-Itz&#225; contains elephant ear (<i>Caladium</i>), mamey (<i>Mammea</i>), figs (<i>Ficus</i>), and other large trees the trunks of which are some 10 meters below the surface of the surrounding tableland. These plants project five to 10 meters above the surrounding low forest. The floor of this
<i>
cenote
</i>
is near the watertable but not below it.

ANNOTATED LIST OF SPECIES
</p>
<p>
Catalogue numbers in the following accounts are those of the Museum of Natural History, The University of Kansas. With the exception of a synoptic collection presented to the Departamento de la Fauna Silvestre, Direcci&#243;n General de Caza, M&#233;xico, D.F., all of the specimens mentioned are in the museum at the University of Kansas.
</p>
<p>
Unless otherwise indicated, specimens taken were not molting. For birds undergoing postnuptial or postjuvenal molt, the degree of advancement of the molt is indicated by the numbers of primaries and rectrices that are new or partly ensheathed. Information on the condition of the testes refers to the left testis unless otherwise noted.
</p>
<p>
Scientific and vernacular names follow Friedmann
<i>
et al.
</i>
(1950) and Miller
<i>
et al.
</i>
(1957) except for specimens of species or genera that have been more thoroughly treated systematically since the publication of the Mexican Checklist, for example,
<i>
Columbina</i>,
<i>
Centurus
</i>
and
<i>
Platypsaris</i>, by Johnston (1962), Selander and Giller (1963), and Webster (1963), respectively. The trinomial is used whenever subspecific identities could be made with a reasonable degree of certainty. The specimens of several kinds were in extremely worn plumage or in molt and meaningful judgments concerning such characters as relative darkness or paleness of plumages could not be made.
</p>
<p>
Specimens are listed in each account according to the temporal order in which they were collected.
</p>

</p>
<p class="small">
Specimen (1): &#9792;, 40402, ovary inactive, 10 x 5 mm., 607.5 gm. (July 12), 5 km. S Champot&#243;n. Mallophaga:

<i>
Cochlearius cochlearius</i>
</b>
(Linnaeus): Boat-billed Heron.&#8212;Three individuals were seen on a small point of land immediately south of the village on the west coast of Isla Mujeres on the afternoon of August 1. One was foraging in a small cove about one mile south of the village on the morning of August 2. Paynter (1955a) did not list the species for Isla Mujeres; our observations seem to constitute the first records for the island.

<b>
<i>
Carthartes burrovianus</i>
</b>
Cassin: Yellow-headed Vulture.&#8212;We saw several Yellow-headed Vultures on Isla del Carmen on July 6, 7, 8, and 9.
<i>
C. burrovianus
</i>
was more abundant than either
<i>
Carthartes aura
</i>
or
<i>
Coragyps atratus
</i>
in the vicinity of Champot&#243;n, where we confirmed field identifications by taking a specimen. Until Wetmore (1950) clarified the status of
<i>
C. burrovianus
</i>
in southern Mexico and Central America, the species had gone unnoticed or misidentified as
<i>
C. aura</i>. The Mexican Checklist (Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore, 1950) omitted
<i>
C. burrovianus
</i>
from the avifauna of M&#233;xico. Blake (1953) included Tabasco, Chiapas, and Veracruz within the range of the species, but Paynter (1955a) omitted it from his list of birds of the Yucat&#225;n Peninsula. Our specimen seemingly constitutes the first record from the peninsula.

<i>
Chondrohierax uncinatus uncinatus</i>
</b>
(Temminck): Hook-billed Kite.&#8212;A pair was seen 5 km. S Champot&#243;n on July 8 and 9. Both birds were in adult plumage and appeared to be mated, although we found no nest. The male is referable to
<i>
C. u. uncinatus
</i>
on the basis of the narrow white ventral bands, most of which are 0.3 millimeter or less in width. None of the bars exceeds 0.5 millimeter in width. Paynter (1955a) discussed in detail the contradictions in the literature concerning the geographic range of this subspecies, and referred a male in his collection taken in February, 1952, to
<i>
C. u. aliquonis</i>. Traylor (1941) collected a large series of this species in Yucat&#225;n and Campeche in winter and allocated the specimens to the nominate form.
</p>
<p>
At Pist&#233;, on July 23, a nestling approximately half-grown was brought in by a local boy. The rectrices were partly ensheathed and the feather count extensively downy.

<i>
Eumomota superciliosa superciliosa</i>
</b>
(Sandbach): Turquoise-browed Motmot.&#8212;On July 9 this species was nesting in a large "colony" 5 km. S Champot&#243;n, Camp&#233;che, in a large abandoned gravel pit having vertical banks about 10 feet high. The pit was an irregular semicircle with an approximate radius of 100 yards and was bordered by a road on one side and elsewhere by low scrub vegetation. The pit was one of several found in the area and formerly was used as a source of limestone gravel used in constructing the road between Champot&#243;n and Esc&#225;rcega. The exposed limestone substratum was overlaid with chalky soil six to eight feet deep.
</p>
<p>
Motmots were nesting in burrows dug in the layer of surface soil. A total of 101 burrows seemed to be in use or to have been used in 1962. Nine appeared to be unused and 24 burrows evidently were abandoned before they were finished. The depths of 12 burrows selected at random were 34, 32, 37, 25, 28, 44, 36, 36, 24, 37, 22, and 43 inches, and averaged 33.4 inches. In cross-section the burrows varied from round (three inches in diameter) to oval (three inches high and four inches wide). The inner ends of the burrows were enlarged with a depression in the floor, where the eggs were laid.
</p>
<p>
The long axes of most burrows were straight and perpendicular to the face of the bank in which they were dug; two burrows nevertheless were curved laterally, and one was U-shaped, having two entrances that opened about 12 inches apart.
</p>
<p>
Eggs and nestlings were found lying on the bare soil at the inner ends of the burrows; no nesting material was found.
</p>
<p>
The contents of 10 burrows that were excavated are summarized in Table 1. Three nests contained no eggs or young. One of these was freshly dug. The other two empty burrows apparently had been recently occupied by nestlings and contained the foul smelling remains of fecal material, hundreds of beetle wings, and other undigestible parts of insects. The manure was teeming with large fly larvae.

<p>
Three burrows contained nestlings; one had four young with pin feathers, one a chick fully feathered, and one three newly hatched young and one egg.
</p>
<p>
In burrow 2, three eggs had advanced embryos and one was infertile; in burrow 3, the eggs had small embryos; and in burrow 4, the eggs appeared fresh. Burrows 3 and 4 were occupied by adult birds that did not flush during the excavation of their burrows. They were easily caught by hand and later prepared as specimens. One was a male and the other a female; each had a brood patch.
</p>
<p>
Possibly females of this species raise more than one brood in a single nesting season, but I have no direct evidence of this. Such an hypothesis is suggested by the different stages of nestings found in the burrows. Moreover, there were more than twice as many burrows as motmots in the area. The largest number of individuals counted at any time near the colony was 20 adults (about an hour after sunrise). Assuming that all of these birds had mates, the maximum number of adults present could have numbered about 40.
</p>
<p>
There is another bit of evidence for double broods. Because of fouling of the burrow that accompanies the raising of a brood of young, it seems improbable that a burrow would be used immediately for a second nesting attempt. Consequently digging a second burrow would be necessary, if a second brood is raised.
</p>
<p>
Most of my observations are in keeping with Skutch's detailed report (1947) of the species in Central America. According to him, eggs are laid in April and May in Honduras and Guatamala, although he did not state that breeding does not occur in other months. The observations in Campeche in early July suggest that breeding can occur over an extended period; Paynter (1955a:158) found the species to be in various stages of reproductive activity in April on the peninsula.
</p>
<p>
Skutch suggested that the motmots he observed in Central America were solitary nesters, and nest in "groups" only where suitable nesting sites are scarce. In Campeche, many suitable, seemingly identical, but unused, nesting sites were available within a few hundred yards of the site of the actual nesting "colony." Moreover, most of the burrows were only a few feet apart and no agonistic behavior was witnessed. It seems that this motmot is characterized by colonial nesting habits in Campeche, even where abundant sites for individual nesting efforts are available.

The species was abundant around the

The plumage was much worn in all specimens and some were in early stages of molt. Apparently the breeding season on the peninsula extends to at least mid-July. The specimen from Isla Cozumel is assigned to
<i>
C. a. dubius</i>, following the systematic treatment by Selander and Giller (1963).

<i>
S. r. serripennis</i>, representing the breeding population occurring from British Columbia and New Hampshire over much of the United States to central California, central Texas, and the Gulf states, has been taken on the peninsula in winter. Paynter referred two specimens taken in late September and three January-taken specimens to
<i>
S. r. stuarti</i>, the highland race that breeds from the mountains of southern Veracruz to Guatamala.
</p>
<p>
Allan R. Phillips had identified two immature individuals (40694 and 40712) from Pist&#233; as
<i>
S. r. stuarti</i>; one specimen from Puerto Juarez also is an immature and is nearly identical to those from Pist&#233;. Two adults from Pist&#233; (40691 and 40710) are noticeably darker dorsally than the immatures but are molting extensively and their identification to subspecies is equivocal. Two other adults (40706 and 40715) were prepared as skeletons.
</p>
<p>
Although mid-July seems early for
<i>
S. r. stuarti
</i>
to be present on the peninsula it is not too surprising since the three specimens positively identified are immature birds and young possibly arrive earlier than do adults. But, the immature specimens possibly are atypical individuals of the resident population of
<i>
S. r. ridgwayi</i>.
</p>
<p>
Except for the immature individual from 5 km. WSW Puerto Juarez, all specimens were taken in mist nets over the
<i>
cenote
</i>
at Pist&#233; where
<i>
Petrochelidon fulva
</i>
also was obtained.

Nelson: Hooded Oriole.&#8212;This species has not heretofore been recorded as breeding on Isla Cozumel; testes were nearly fully enlarged but probably regressing in the only specimen taken there. It had been banded (USF&#38;WS no. 601-87003) on the island in 1961 as an adult. According to Paynter (1955a:269) there are no breeding records for this species on the mainland later than April, March 25 being the earliest date. The species was observed nesting on Isla del Carmen and adult males taken there and 5 km. S Champot&#243;n in early July were in full breeding condition.

Locality records are given for each of 136 species of birds represented by 493 specimens and sight records are given for eight additional species.
</p>
<p>
The Yellow-headed Vulture is reported apparently for the first time from the peninsula. The specimens of the Streak-headed Woodhewer and the Louisiana Waterthrush are the second ones of each species taken on the peninsula. The Purple Martin taken on August 14, the Barn Swallow on August 18, and the Louisiana Waterthrush on August 14 represent earliest known autumn dates for these transients.
</p>
<p>
Evidence for breeding is given for 20 species for the first time and extensions of the known breeding seasons are presented for 41 species.
</p>
<p>
Fourteen genera, representing about 19 species, of Mallophaga are reported for 20 different species of bird hosts.
</p>
<p>
At Pist&#233; and Puerto Juarez, species of birds such as the Blue Honeycreeper and the Red-capped Manakin, normally thought of as characteristic of more humid areas, were found breeding in numbers near
<i>
cenotes</i>. However, they were not seen to venture far into the surrounding deciduous forest. The availability of suitable habitat brought on by the rainy season and the regular occurrence of
<i>
cenotes
</i>
helps to explain the presence of such species far outside the Rain Forest zone.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

     Chief Executive and Director
     gbnewby@pglaf.org


Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
